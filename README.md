### Using Jest to pass the tests

- Developer Ready: Complete and ready to set-up JavaScript testing solution. Works out of the box for any React project.
- Instant Feedback: Fast interactive watch mode runs only test files related to changed files and is optimized to give signal quickly
- Snapshot Testing: Capture snapshots of React trees or other serializable values to simplify testing and to analyze how state changes over time
- Zero configuration testing platform: Jest is used by Facebook to test all JavaScript code including React applications. One of Jest's philosophies is to provide an integrated "zero-configuration" experience. We observed that when engineers are provided with ready-to-use tools, they end up writing more tests, which in turn results in more stable and healthy code bases.

- Fast and sandboxed: Jest parallelizes test runs across workers to maximize performance. Console messages are buffered and printed together with test results. Sandboxed test files and automatic global state resets for every test so no two tests conflict with each other.
